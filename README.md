![Attrition Count by Department](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b031b9e-7413-490c-8909-e46c87185230)
 
1. Research and Development Department has the highest number of attrition potentially due to lack of research training and growth opportunities.

### Attrition Count by Gender

   ![Attrition Count by Gender](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8393987a-edec-4b19-85af-f02b44a2c2f5)

Key Inferences

1. Male attrition rate: 63.2% (150/237 total males)
2. Female attrition rate: 36.8% (87/237 total females)
3. Males are 1.72 times more likely to leave than females.
   
The above inferences may be as a result of the following reason:
- Higher male attrition may indicate dissatisfaction or lack of engagement.
- Females may experience better job satisfaction, work-life balance or organizational support.
- Potential differences in career advancement opportunities.

### Attrition Count by Educational Field

Key Inferences

1. Life sciences and medical fields have high attrition count (89 and 65).
2. Life sciences and medical graduates often work in research and development.
3. Research and development's high stress and pressure may contribute to life sciences and medical fields' attrition.
   
Actionable Insights

   - Analyze department-specific stressors and address through targeted support.
   - Enhance work-life balance and wellness initiatives.
   - Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing across departments.
   - Develop tailored retention strategies for high-attrition fields/departments.

### Attrition based on Gender and Age group

   ![Attrition Count by Gender and Age Group](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a17b133a-2187-4b96-908b-9e8827b11eb7)

Key Inferences

1. Higher Male Attrition: Males leave the organization more frequently than females.
2. Age-Specific Turnover: Male employees aged 25-34 and 35-44 have higher attrition rates.

Demographic Trends

1. Younger males (25-34) may seek career growth, better opportunities or work-life balance.
2. Mid-career males (35-44) may experience mid-life crises, reevaluate priorities or seek new challenges.

The following organisation factors may be the cause of the above attrition dispartity:

   - Inadequate career development opportunities.
   - Poor work-life balance or flexibility.
   - Leadership or management issues.
   - Compensation or benefits disparities.

The attrition rate especially among the male employees may affect the Industry leading to:
   - High turnover rates in male-dominated industries.
   - Potential brain drain: losing experienced talent.

Key Inference

1. Higher Male Retention: Males employees still dominate the organisation despite the number of people who left.
2. Age-Specific Turnover: Male employees aged 25-34 and 35-44 have higher retention rates.

Actionable Insight

The organization should investigate and address the reasons behind the higher male attrition rate and gender disparity.
